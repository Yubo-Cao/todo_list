GSMST, and is not affiliated with GSMST or eClass in any way.

In short, using this software is at your own risk. There may be bugs, security risks,
etc. Specifically, your PASSWORD and USERNAME, if entered, will be stored in {path} as
utf-8 encoded bytes, i.e., plain text. However, if you feel bad about it, you can
download html manually by hand and this program shall parse it. But I believe it would
be more cumbersome than just use calculator, so this option won't be supported well.
