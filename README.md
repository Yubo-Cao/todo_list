# School Notify

This is software that integrates the functionality of StudentVUE into the
desktop environment, allowing you to receive notifications about your grades
and assignments.

This software is developed with the following goals:

- To be as lightweight as possible (no Webdriver, no Electron, no CSS frameworks)
- To be as fast as possible (asynchronous, concurrent, and parallel)
- To be as secure as possible (encryption of password)
- To be as extensible as possible (extensive documentation and modularity)

It does not aim to be cross-platform, but it should work on any platform that
supports Python 3.10.
